This is great, Jumbomob is up and running! 
There are a lot of extraordinary things to talk and share with you.

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World");
    }
}
```

"Information flow is what the Internet is about. Information sharing is power. If you don't share your ideas, smart people can't do anything about them, and you'll remain anonymous and powerless." (Vint Cerf)
